Maybe not needed, unless specific common usecase found to support:
- Demander modes: AND/OR 
  - Mode AND: supply target with "item 1 AND item 2..."
  - Mode OR: supply target with "item 1" OR (if not available) "item 2"
- API improvements: The API isn't much of an API in most cases, it barely allows customization. May be worth generifiying some of it sometime.
